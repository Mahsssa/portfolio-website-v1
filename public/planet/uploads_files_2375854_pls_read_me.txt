Hey thanks for downloading my model! This is an original model created in Blender 2.83a (compatible with blender 2.8 series). I hope you find it useful, if you use it in a project please email me at nicmacanimations@gmail.com or tag me on instagram @nicmacanimations.  OBJ, FBX, DAE, PLY, ABC and BLEND files should be included in this folder. You can edit and rerender this object as much as you wish but I ask you give credit to me as the original creator in the video description or in a title card.

Your's till death do us part,
Nick.
